# Made this repository public


## Context and Problem Statement

The Github documentation is not very clear, whether I can access actions in another of my private repositories.
I understood it would be possible, later read on stackoverflow that is onyl possible with the enterprise plan.
Copilot Chat said no, not possible.
And well, it did not work for me, so i was forced to make this repo public in order to reuse the actions

## Considered Options
Make this Repository privat - which did not work for me, the using workflow said something like repository not found.

## Decision Outcome
Made this repository public
